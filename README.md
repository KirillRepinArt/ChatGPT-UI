# ChatGPT-UI

This is a css style for [text-generation-webui][1] that looks like ChatGPT. (April 28th 2024 version)

## Getting Started

1. Download `sohne-Regular_this one.otf` font, and install it.
    - Mac: use Font Book for this (File --> Add Fonts to Current User)
2. Download `TestSÃ¶hneMono-Leicht.otf` font, and place it into [text-generation-webui\css][2] folder.
3. Download `chat_style-Chat-GPT.css`,
   and place it into [text-generation-webui\css][2] folder.
4. Launch text-generation-webui's web server.
5. Scroll down to see Chat style,
   and select Chat-GPT from the available chat styles.
6. That's it.

This style is meant to be used only in a chat setting, I haven't styled other pages like 'Parameters', 'Model' and so on.

Couple of notes.
1. If this style works for you and you would like to keep using it, I suggest caution when updating TexGen. The changes in the main repo might affect the names of the groups I've targeted with CSS, which would result in Chat-GPT style not working properly.
2. This style doesn't do too good on mobile.
3. When renaming chats 'cancel' button is missing. Can't figure that one out.
