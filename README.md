# ChatGPT-UI
This is a css style for text-generation-webui that looks like ChatGPT. 

I chose an older version of textgen as a base to work from, because it works faster on my PC, so I made a style for myself to use.

Newer versions of text-generation-webui have different structure and when I tried my style, it wouldn't work correctly, so that's a shame.

I've attached all of the files that I think one might need, including the font **Sohne**. 

It's the main font for ChatGPT, I think it makes a big difference for the overall design. The versions of this font that I've found didn't work with the UI, so I had to modify it, remove some symbols and change the forma a couple of times. I highly recommend installing the version of the font I've provided, if you want to get that ChatGPT look.

This is my first attempt in CSS, my goal was to create a chat window, so all of the other ones don't look good, some a barely usable tbh. But the chat itself works pretty good, as far as I can tell.

I've also attached .ico file, I use it to changes the standard look of the .bat file, and a character card with the very basic assistant. But it looks nice with the new design.
