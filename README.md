# ChatGPT-UI
This is a css style for text-generation-webui that looks like ChatGPT. 

I chose an older version of textgen as a base to work from, because it works faster on my PC, so I made a style for myself to use.

Newer versions of text-generation-webui have different structure and when I tried my style, it wouldn't work correctly, so that's a shame.

I've attached all of the files that I think one might need, including the font **Sohne**. 

It's the main font for ChatGPT, I think it makes a big difference for the overall design. The versions of the font that I've found, refuse to display in the browser.
I've noticed that there were other attempts to use this font for other styles, but my browser (Brave) was still rendering Arial.

But the version of the font in the repo seem to work with the browser just fine, I highly recommend installing the version of the font I've provided, if you want to get that ChatGPT look.

This is my first attempt in CSS, my goal was to create a chat window, so all of the other ones don't look good, some a barely usable tbh. But the chat itself works pretty good, as far as I can tell.

I've also attached .ico file, I use it to changes the standard look of the .bat file, and a character card with the very basic assistant. But it looks nice with the new design.

In server.py I just added "Send a message" placeholder, it already exists in the newer versions, but not in this one. CSS and .js files should be placed into ccss folder inside text-generation-webui, but make sure you made the backup version of the originals.

And just in case it wasn't obvious, this is the first thing I've made with CSS ever. 
I did in 8 days with the help of ChatGPT, it wouldn't be possible for me otherwise. But all things considered I'm quite proud of the result, I must say.
